# SOHO Network 

## Objective

The SOHO project focused on setting up and configuring a Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) network using Cisco Packet Tracer. Implemented DHCP and DNS for automatic IP assignment and name resolution. VLANs were configured for logical separation between departments, and inter-VLAN communication was established through trunking to enable seamless connectivity.

### Skills Learned
- Designing and configuring a SOHO network
- Configuring DNS and DHCP services
- Creating and assigning VLANS for logical segmentation
- Implenting trunking for inter-vlan communication
- Troubleshoot network configuration issues

### Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer

### Topology and .pkt File
- [`SOHO Project.pkt`](./SOHO%20Project.pkt)
