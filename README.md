# SOHO Network 

## Objective

The SOHO project focused on setting up and configuring a Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) network using Cisco Packet Tracer. Implemented DHCP and DNS for automatic IP assignment and name resolution. VLANs were configured for logical separation between departments, and inter-VLAN communication was established through trunking to enable seamless connectivity.
